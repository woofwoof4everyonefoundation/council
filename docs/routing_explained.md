# Task → Trait → Model Routing

Council routing is deliberately simple:

1. A task declares which behavioral traits matter.
2. A model declares what behavioral traits it exhibits.
3. Council scores the overlap.
4. The best match wins.
5. Council explains the decision in plaintext.

No weights, no scores, no tuning.
Users may override traits or add custom traits at any time.
