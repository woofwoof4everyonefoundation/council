# Why Subjective Traits?

Benchmarks describe correctness.
They do not describe *behavior*.

Most developers choose models by feel:
- "This one is more stable."
- "This one is less likely to hallucinate."
- "This one handles ambiguity better."
- "This one writes cleaner code."

Council formalizes that intuition without pretending it's objective.
