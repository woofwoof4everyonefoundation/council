# Contributing to Council

The Council framework is intentionally minimal, subjective, and fully local.  
It is designed to be **forked freely**, adapted to individual workflows, and extended in whatever direction suits your needs.

Because of this, **there is no centralized contribution process**.

If you want to build on it:

- **Fork the repository.**
- Change anything you like.
- Publish your own variant.
- Keep it private or share it — entirely your choice.

The framework is deliberately small so that anyone can shape it without needing approval or coordination.

If you notice improvements that feel broadly useful, you are welcome to open a pull request — but there is **no expectation** that it will be reviewed or merged. Forks are considered a healthy and intended part of this project’s ecosystem.

Thank you for exploring the Council framework, and may it serve as a helpful tool in your own model evaluation and routing workflows.
